This project has been created to implement a smart lighting system proof of concept for "{}\+Progettazione di Sistemi Operativi"{} exam at University of Milan accademic year 2023/2024.

This particular repository is linked with \href{https://github.com/sioel0/STM32_Smart_Lighting_System}{\texttt{ STM32\+\_\+\+Smart\+\_\+\+Lighting\+\_\+\+System}} which is the other part of the project. This repository in particular contains a firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico which, with the use of \href{https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LoRa-SX1262}{\texttt{ Wave\+Share Pico Lora shield}}, is used to manage all the communication part of the project. In the roles folder there are two different implementations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item router is used to send commands to the lighting system from remote
\item client is used on the lighting part to receive and send additional data to the router 
\end{DoxyItemize}
